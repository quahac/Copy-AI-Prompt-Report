# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: June 2025_

This Chrome extension (“the Extension”) respects your privacy. Below is a clear explanation of what data is collected, stored, or transmitted and how it's used.

## 1. No Personal Data Collected

This extension does **not** collect, track, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.

## 2. Local-Only Storage

All user-generated data (such as custom templates) is stored locally using Chrome’s `storage.sync` API. This means your data is:
- Stored only in your browser
- Optionally synced between your devices if you are logged into Chrome with sync enabled
- Never sent to any external server

## 3. No External Communication

This extension does **not** make any network requests to external servers.  
No analytics, telemetry, or background connections are made.

## 4. Required Permissions

The extension requests only the minimum permissions necessary to function:

- `contextMenus` – to show template actions in the right-click menu  
- `activeTab` – to access the tab the user is interacting with  
- `scripting` – to run scripts that extract page content and copy it to the clipboard  
- `storage` – to save and load custom templates  
- `<all_urls>` – to allow the extension to work on any webpage when triggered by the user

These permissions are only used when the user interacts with the extension. No data is accessed in the background or without direct user action.

## 5. No Ads, No Tracking

The extension does not include:
- Ads
- Analytics
- User tracking of any kind

## 6. Contact

If you have any questions, concerns, or requests regarding this privacy policy, please contact the developer via GitHub or the support page listed in the Chrome Web Store.
